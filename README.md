# "AUTOMATING THE DEPLOYMENT OF NETWORK SETUPS"
The project is to develop software to build a virtual network of PCs in an automated way using Vagrant.
## DESIGN
I have designed the software so that the user can choose the number of PCs (from 1 to 6) in a star configuration, with a central router connecting the PCs together, and automatically generate Vagrant scripts, which will activate the Virtual Machines and the router and connect them properly after launching the `vagrant up` command.

To implement my software I used Tkinter, a Python GUI (Graphical User Interface) package, and created a simple window with buttons where the user choose the VMs' number.

## IMPLEMENTATIONS
### Configuring the GUI

### Commands 
Here there is a list of the commands I used (all preceded by `sudo` because every command has to be executed by the superuser):
- [**IP FORWARDING**] I enabled the IPv4 forwarding in the router with `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`;
- [**IP**] I assigned an IP address to each interface, with the command `ip addr add [ip_address/netmask] dev [interface]` and then I activated that interface with `ip link set dev [interface] up`;
